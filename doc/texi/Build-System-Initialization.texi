@chapter Build System Initialization

@noindent
If you are working with the Git repository or a tree archive, then the
first step is to initialize the build system@.
If you are working with a distribution archive, then you should skip
this step, as the build system is already initialized@.
To initialize the build system, run the following command after making
sure that you have the GNU Autotools installed:

@example
autoreconf@w{ }-@w{-}install
@end example
@ifxml
@ifnotxml
