@chapter @w{@t{gatbps}} Output Files

For each operand
@w{@i{R}}
for which generation
is enabled, the file
@w{@i{R}}
is generated and the ten files
@w{@i{R}@t{.@:gatbps0}}
through
@w{@i{R}@t{.@:gatbps9}}
are reserved for temporary use@.
If any temporary file
is nonregular or a directory,
then all of them are ignored
and generation fails@.
Otherwise, some of them may
be used during generation and
all of them are deleted after
generation succeeds or fails@.
If generation fails, then
@w{@i{R}}
is not necessarily deleted@.
If the program is
terminated by a signal, then
no files are necessarily deleted@.
