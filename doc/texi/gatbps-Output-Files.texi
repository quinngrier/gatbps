@chapter @w{@t{gatbps}} Output Files

For each operand
@w{@i{X}}
for which generation
is enabled, the file
@w{@i{X}}
is generated and the ten files
@w{@i{X}@t{.@:gatbps0}}
through
@w{@i{X}@t{.@:gatbps9}}
are reserved for temporary use@.
The generation
of@tie{}@w{@i{X}}
begins by verifying that each temporary file either definitely exists as
a regular file or definitely does not exist@.
If this fails, then no further action is taken and the generation
of@tie{}@w{@i{X}}
fails@.
Otherwise, some of them may
be used during generation and
all of them are deleted after
generation succeeds or fails@.
If generation fails, then
@w{@i{X}}
is not necessarily deleted@.
If the program is
terminated by a signal, then
no files are necessarily deleted@.
