@chapter @w{@t{gatbps}} Output Files

@noindent
For each
operand@tie{}@w{@i{X}}
for which generation is enabled
(@pxref{@w{@t{gatbps}} Operands}),
the
file@tie{}@w{@i{X}}
is attempted to be generated, and the ten files
@w{@i{X}@t{.@:tmp0}}
through
@w{@i{X}@t{.@:tmp9}}
are reserved for temporary use during this process@.
Generation begins by attempting to delete the temporary files in
numerical order with individual
@w{@t{rm -f}}
commands@.
If any of these commands fails, then generation stops and processing
continues to the next phase@.
Otherwise, some of them may
be used during generation and
all of them are deleted after
generation succeeds or fails@.
If generation fails, then
@w{@i{X}}
is not necessarily deleted@.
If the program is
terminated by a signal, then
no files are necessarily deleted@.
