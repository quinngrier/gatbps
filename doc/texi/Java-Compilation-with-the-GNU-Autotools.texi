@node Java Compilation with the GNU Autotools
@chapter Java Compilation with the GNU Autotools

@noindent
GATBPS provides a set of special files for Java compilation with the GNU
Autotools using the standard
@w{@t{javac}}
and
@w{@t{jar}}
tools@.

@sfindex @w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAR.@:m4}}
@sfindex @w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAVAC.@:m4}}
@include indent.texi
The first step is to set the
@w{@t{JAVAC}}
and
@w{@t{JAR}}
variables in your makefile to commands that run the
@w{@t{javac}}
and
@w{@t{jar}}
tools@.
You can do this with the
@w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAVAC}}
and
@w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAR}}
Autoconf macros, which are defined by the
@w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAVAC.@:m4}}
and
@w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAR.@:m4}}
special files@.
The macros take no arguments and set up the variables by calling the
@w{@t{AC_CHECK_PROGS}}
and
@w{@t{AC_ARG_VAR}}
macros appropriately@.
If you are not using Automake, then you also need to add
@w{@t{JAVAC = @@JAVAC@@}}
and
@w{@t{JAR = @@JAR@@}}
to your
@w{@t{Makefile.@:in}}
file@.
