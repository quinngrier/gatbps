@chapter Java Compilation with the GNU Autotools

@noindent
GATBPS provides a set of special files to support Java compilation with
the GNU Autotools using the standard
@w{@t{javac}}
and
@w{@t{jar}}
utilities@.

@sfindex @w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAR.@:m4}}
@sfindex @w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAVAC.@:m4}}
@include indent.texi
The first step is to ensure that the
@w{@t{JAVAC}}
and
@w{@t{JAR}}
variables in your makefile will be set to commands that run the
@w{@t{javac}}
and
@w{@t{jar}}
utilities@.
The recommended way to do this is by using the
@w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAVAC}}
and
@w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAR}}
Autoconf macros, which are provided by the
@w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAVAC.@:m4}}
and
@w{@t{GATBPS_PROG_JAR.@:m4}}
special files@.
