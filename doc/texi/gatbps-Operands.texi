@chapter @t{gatbps} Operands

Each operand is
processed in three phases:
printing, generation, and recursion@.
Printing writes the
operand to standard output,
generation creates the file,
and recursion prepends prerequisite
files to the remaining arguments@.
Recursion only applies to special files@.
Various options
can be used to enable
or disable each phase,
but printing and generation
cannot be simultaneously disabled@.
By default, only generation is enabled@.
