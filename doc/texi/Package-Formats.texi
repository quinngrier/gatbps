@chapter Package Formats

@noindent
GATBPS is available in three different package formats: as a copy of the
Git repository, as a tree archive, and as a distribution archive@.
The Git repository is the master copy of the package, a tree archive is
a snapshot of the Git repository at a particular moment of time, and a
distribution archive is a tree archive that has been streamlined for
building and installation@.
More detailed differences between these formats are documented
throughout this manual where relevant@.

@include indent.texi
If you are not sure which package format you are working with, then you
can distinguish them as follows:

@enumerate
@item
If there is a subdirectory named
@w{@t{.@:git}}
in the directory that contains the
@w{@t{configure.@:ac}}
file, then you are working with a copy of the Git repository@.

@item
Otherwise, if there is a subdirectory named
@w{@t{dev-aux}}
in the directory that contains the
@w{@t{configure.@:ac}}
file, then you are working with a tree archive@.

@item
Otherwise, you are working with a distribution archive@.
@end enumerate

@include indent.texi
If you are only interested in building and installing the package, then
you probably want to be working with a distribution archive@.
Distribution archives are streamlined for building and installation@.

@include indent.texi
If you are only interested in browsing the source code of the package,
then you probably want to be working with a copy of the Git repository
or a tree archive@.
Distribution archives exclude some of the source code@.

@include indent.texi
If you are interested in modifying the source code of the package, then
you probably want to be working with a copy of the Git repository@.
Copies of the Git repository provide version control and include the
complete development history of the package@.
