@chapter Checking for Missing Autoconf Macros

@noindent
GATBPS provides a number of special files that define Autoconf macros@.
The files follow the
@w{@t{aclocal}}
conventions so that they are easy to use@.
Each file defines a main macro and zero or more helper macros that are
intended to be used only by the main macro@.
You can selectively use only the files that you need, but some main
macros depend on other main macros, so you must remember to include
those files too@.
You can list these dependencies with the
@w{@t{-@w{-}dry-run}}
and
@w{@t{-@w{-}recursive}}
options of the
@w{@t{gatbps}}
program, but it is still easy to forget some of them@.
GATBPS provides a system that can catch such mistakes at Autoconf time@.
