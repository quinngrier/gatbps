@chapter Checking for Missing Autoconf Macros

@noindent
GATBPS provides a number of special files that define Autoconf macros,
with each file defining exactly one macro@.
There are several ways that you can include the files in your
@w{@t{configure.@:ac}}
file, but the intended way is by using
@w{@t{aclocal}}
program@.
Some of the macros need to use others, but it is easy to forget to
include one of the files@.
GATBPS provides a system that can catch such mistakes at Autoconf time@.
