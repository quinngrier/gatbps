@chapter @w{@t{gatbps}} Description

@noindent
@w{@t{gatbps}}
generates basic files for software packages@.
The arguments are processed one at a time, in order@.
Each argument is classified either as an operand or (roughly) as an
option@.
Each operand generates a file, and each option changes the overall
behavior of the program@.
Each operand is classified by its file name as either special or plain@.
There is a fixed list of special files, and any other file is plain@.
Each special file is fixed in content, with examples including copyright
texts and scripts to be used with the build system@.
Each plain file is generated as the plain text output of a corresponding
Texinfo file, which is useful for writing files like
@w{@t{README}}
and
@w{@t{INSTALL}}@.
