@chapter Formatting Automake Variable Sections

@noindent
A sequence of zero or more lines that is immediately preceded by a line
containing exactly
``@w{@t{## begin_variables}}'',
that is immediately followed by a line containing exactly
``@w{@t{## end_variables}}'',
and that does not contain any lines beginning with
``@w{@t{## begin_}}''
or
``@w{@t{## end_}}''
is called an
@i{Automake variable section}@.
If the last line of a variable section ends with a
`@w{@t{\}}'@tie{}character,
then a blank line is implicitly appended to the variable section@.

@example
foo =
# A comment block can go here.
## Automake comments are okay too.
foo += bar
foo += baz
