@cindex Automake variable section
@cindex variable section, Automake
@noindent
A sequence of zero or more lines of text that is immediately preceded by
a line containing exactly
``@w{@t{## begin_variables}}'',
that is immediately followed by a line containing exactly
``@w{@t{## end_variables}}'',
and that does not contain any lines beginning with
``@w{@t{## begin_}}''
or
``@w{@t{## end_}}''
is called an
@i{Automake variable section}@.
If the last line of an Automake variable section ends with a
``@w{@t{\}}''@tie{}character,
then a blank line is implicitly added to the end of the variable
section@.
Each maximal contiguous subsequence of lines that consists of a line not
ending with a
``@w{@t{\}}''@tie{}character
along with all immediately preceding lines ending with
``@w{@t{\}}''@tie{}characters
is called a
@i{logical line}@.
The original lines are often called
@i{physical lines}
to reduce confusion@.
Each maximal contiguous subsequence of logical lines that does not
contain a logical line containing exactly an empty physical line is
called a
@i{variable paragraph}@.

@example
## begin_variables

foo =
# A comment block can go here.
## Automake comments are okay too.
foo += bar
foo += baz

## end_variables
@end example

@example
foo +=
# A comment block can go here.
