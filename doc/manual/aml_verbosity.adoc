[#aml_verbosity]
= Verbosity

GATBPS defines `GATBPS_at = @` and uses `$(GATBPS_at)` instead of plain
`@` or `$({aml_AM_V_at})` for all recipe lines that should normally be
silent.
This way, you can produce various levels of verbosity by passing one or
more of `V=1`, `AM_V_at=`, and `GATBPS_at=` to `make`.
For example, running `make V=1 AM_V_at= GATBPS_at=` will produce highly
verbose output.
