gatbps_protect([<arg>...])

The `gatbps_protect` macro protects every identifier `x` appearing
anywhere in the arguments from expansion by calling
`m4_pushdef([x], [[x]])`.
The identifiers can later be unprotected by calling
xref:acl_gatbps_unprotect.adoc#acl_gatbps_unprotect[`gatbps_unprotect`]
with the same arguments.
