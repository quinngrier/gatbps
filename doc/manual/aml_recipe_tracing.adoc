The `GATBPS_RECIPE_MARKER_TOP` and `GATBPS_RECIPE_MARKER_BOT` variables
can be used to mark the start and finish of a recipe, which can be
useful when analyzing the output of `make`.
Each variable expands to a no-op command that includes `$@`, resulting
in the command itself acting as a marker message when it is written to
standard output by `make`.
