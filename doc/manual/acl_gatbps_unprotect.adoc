The `gatbps_unprotect` macro unprotects every identifier `x` appearing
anywhere in the arguments from expansion by calling `m4_popdef([x])`.
The identifiers are unprotected in the reverse order of the
corresponding earlier call to
xref:acl_gatbps_protect.adoc#acl_gatbps_protect[`gatbps_protect`]
with the same arguments.
