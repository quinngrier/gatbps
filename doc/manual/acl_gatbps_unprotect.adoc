gatbps_unprotect([<arg>...])
----

The `gatbps_unprotect` macro unprotects every identifier `x` appearing
anywhere in the arguments from expansion by calling `m4_popdef([x])`.
Each call should have a corresponding previous call to
xref:acl_gatbps_protect.adoc#acl_gatbps_protect[`gatbps_protect`]
with the same arguments in the same order.
The identifiers are unprotected in the reverse order that they were
protected.
