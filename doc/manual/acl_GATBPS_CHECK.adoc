{acl_GATBPS_CHECK}(<message>, <name>, <code>)
----

The `{acl_GATBPS_CHECK}` macro extends the `{acl_AC_CACHE_CHECK}` macro
as follows:

* The cache variable is named `g_cv_<name>`.

* `<name>` is set to `$g_cv_<name>` after `{acl_AC_CACHE_CHECK}`
completes.

* `<name>_was_cached` is set to `:` or `false` to indicate whether
`<name>` was cached.

* The end of `<name>` may include zero or more specifiers, each of which
consists of a `:` character followed by an identifier.
These specifiers are removed from `<name>` when forming variable names.

* If `:nobool` is specified at the end of `<name>`, then boolean
detection is disabled.
Otherwise, boolean detection is enabled and all of the following occur:

** If `g_cv_<name>` is set to `yes` or `no`, then all of the following
occur:

*** `<name>` is set to `1` or `0` instead of `yes` or `no`.

*** `<name>_sh` is set to `:` or `false` to indicate whether `$<name>`
is `1` or `0`.

*** `{acl_AC_DEFINE}` is called for `<name>`.

** If `g_cv_<name>` is set to something other than `yes` or `no`, then
`<name>_sh` is set to `false`.

** `{aml_AM_CONDITIONAL}` is called for `<name>` using `$<name>_sh`.

* If `:bool` is specified at the end of `<name>`, then the `:nobool`
specifier is ignored and boolean behavior is obliged: an error will
occur if `g_cv_<name>` is not set to `yes` or `no`.
