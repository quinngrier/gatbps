{acl_GATBPS_CHECK}(<message>, <name>, <code>)
----

The `{acl_GATBPS_CHECK}` macro extends the `{acl_AC_CACHE_CHECK}` macro
as follows:

* The cache variable is named `g_cv_<name>`.

* `<name>` is set to `$g_cv_<name>` after `{acl_AC_CACHE_CHECK}`
completes.

* `<name>_was_cached` is set to `:` or `false` to indicate whether
`<name>` was cached.

* If `<name>` is set to `yes` or `no`, the result of the check is
assumed to be a boolean and all of the following occur:

** `<name>` is adjusted to `1` or `0`.

** `<name>_sh` is set to `:` or `false`.

** `{acl_AC_DEFINE}` is called for `<name>`.

** `{aml_AM_CONDITIONAL}` is called for `<name>`.
