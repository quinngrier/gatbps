[#sh-gatbps-csf]
= The `gatbps_csf` variable

.Shell
[source,subs="{subs_source}"]
----
gatbps_csf=pass:n[...]
${sh_gatbps_readonly} gatbps_csf
----

The `{sh_gatbps_csf}` variable holds a `{sh_sed}` script that can be
used to help perform command substitutions that only remove a single
trailing newline character instead of as many trailing newline
characters as possible.

[example]
====
The following code sets `dir` to an absolute path to the current working
directory with correct behavior even if the path ends with one or more
newline characters:

[source,subs="{subs_source}"]
----
dir=++`++{sh_pwd} && {sh_echo} x++`++ || {sh_exit} {sh_es}
dir=++`++{sh_eval} {sh_LC_ALL}=C "${SED:-{sh_sed}}" '"${{sh_gatbps_csf}?}"' <<EOF
${dir?}
EOF
++`++ || {sh_exit} {sh_es}
{sh_eval} dir="${dir?}"
