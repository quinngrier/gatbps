Macro arguments are notated with a single or double pair of `<>`
brackets.
A single pair of `<>` brackets (e.g., `<foo>`) indicates that the
argument is expanded once: during argument collection for the macro
call.
A double pair of `<>` brackets (e.g., `<<foo>>`) indicates that the
argument is expanded twice: during argument collection for the macro
call, and again when the result of the call is rescanned for expansion.
