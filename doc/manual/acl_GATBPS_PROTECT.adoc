GATBPS_PROTECT([<arg>...])

The `GATBPS_PROTECT` macro protects every identifier `x` appearing
anywhere in the arguments from expansion by calling
`m4_pushdef([x], [[x]])`.
The identifiers can later be unprotected by calling
xref:acl_GATBPS_UNPROTECT.adoc#acl_GATBPS_UNPROTECT[`GATBPS_UNPROTECT`]
with the same arguments.
