.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
.nohy "\fBgatbps\fR"
generates basic files
for software packages.
The arguments
are processed one
at a time, in order.
Each argument
is classified as
either an operand or
(roughly) as an option.
Each operand
generates a file,
and each option changes the
overall behavior of the program.
Each operand is
classified by its file
name as either special or plain.
There is a fixed
list of special files,
and any other file is plain.
Each special file
is fixed in content,
with examples including
copyright texts and scripts
to be used with the build system.
Each plain file is
generated as the plain text
output of a corresponding Texinfo file,
which is useful for writing files like
.nohy "\fBREADME\fR"
and
.nohy "\fBINSTALL\fR."
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP
Each option has
one or more names, and each
name is either long or short.
Each long name consists of two
hyphen-minus characters followed by
zero or more printable characters except
for the space and equals sign characters,
and each short name consists of one hyphen-minus
character followed by one printable character
except for the space and hyphen-minus characters.
Each option either requires a value,
permits a value, or forbids a value.
.LP
Let
.nohy "\fB\-\-\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fB\-\fIS\fR"
be long and short names for an option and
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
be a value.
If the option
requires a value,
then it may be written as either
.nohy "\fB\-\-\fIL\fB=\fIV\fR,"
.nohy "\fB\-\-\fIL\ V\fR,"
.nohy "\fB\-\fISV\fR,"
or
.nohy "\fB\-\fIS\ V\fR."
If the option
permits a value,
then it may be written as either
.nohy "\fB\-\-\fIL\fB=\fIV\fR,"
.nohy "\fB\-\-\fIL\fR,"
.nohy "\fB\-\fISV\fR,"
or
.nohy "\fB\-\fIS\fR."
If the option
forbids a value,
then it may be written as either
.nohy "\fB\-\-\fIL\fR"
or
.nohy "\fB\-\fIS\fR,"
and in the latter case
it may be combined with an
immediately following argument in
(combined) short form by deleting the
.nohy "\fB\-\fIS\fR"
argument and inserting the
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
character into the following
argument just after the leading
.nohy "\fB\-\fR"
character.
.LP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-\fR"
option disables option detection,
causing all remaining arguments
to be interpreted as operands.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-all\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
.TPZ
.nohy "\fB\-a\fR[\fIV\fR]"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-all\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
option prepends the
names of all special files
to the remaining arguments.
Each name is prefixed with
.nohy "\fIV\fR."
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is omitted, then it
is taken to be empty.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is not empty and does not
end with a slash character,
then a slash character is appended to
.nohy "\fIV\fR."
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-awk=\fIV\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-awk=\fIV\fR"
option sets the command name
that will be used to invoke the
.nohy "\fBawk\fR"
program to
.nohy "\fIV\fR."
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBauto\fR,"
then the command name is inferred.
The copy of the
program that corresponds
to this copy of the manual page
behaves as if an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-awk=@AWK_DEFAULT_TROFF@\fR"
option were added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and before any argument added by the
.nohy "\fBAWK\fR"
environment variable.
Other copies may use other initial values.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-boundary\fR"
.TPZ
.nohy "\fB\-b\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-boundary\fR"
option enables recursion
for the next operand but
not for its prerequisites.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR"
.TPZ
.nohy "\fB\-n\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR"
option enables printing and disables generation.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-help\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-help\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
option writes text to standard output and
causes all remaining arguments to be ignored.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is omitted, then
the text is a short description of the program.
Otherwise, the text is a short description
of the file that would be generated by the
.nohy "\fBgatbps\ \-\-\ \fIV\fR"
command.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-man\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-man\fR"
option writes text to standard output and
causes all remaining arguments to be ignored.
The text is the source code
of the program's manual page,
which can be processed with any
command that is analogous to the
.nohy "\fBtbl\ |\ nroff\ \-man\fR"
command.
In particular, the
.nohy "\fBman\ \-l\ \-\fR"
command can be used on most systems.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-no\-dry\-run\fR"
.TPZ
.nohy "\fB\-N\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-no\-dry\-run\fR"
option disables printing and enables generation.
However, printing remains enabled if the
.nohy "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
option is in effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-no\-recursive\fR"
.TPZ
.nohy "\fB\-R\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-no\-recursive\fR"
option disables recursion.
However, this does not affect the
.nohy "\fB\-\-boundary\fR"
option.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-no\-verbose\fR"
.TPZ
.nohy "\fB\-V\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-no\-verbose\fR"
option disables printing.
However, printing remains enabled if the
.nohy "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR"
option is in effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-recursive\fR"
.TPZ
.nohy "\fB\-r\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-recursive\fR"
option enables recursion.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-sed=\fIV\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-sed=\fIV\fR"
option sets the command name
that will be used to invoke the
.nohy "\fBsed\fR"
program to
.nohy "\fIV\fR."
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBauto\fR,"
then the command name is inferred.
The copy of the
program that corresponds
to this copy of the manual page
behaves as if an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-sed=@SED_DEFAULT_TROFF@\fR"
option were added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and before any argument added by the
.nohy "\fBSED\fR"
environment variable.
Other copies may use other initial values.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
option prepends an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr\fR"
option and an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout\fR"
option to the remaining arguments.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is omitted, then neither
instance is given a value.
Otherwise, both are given the value
.nohy "\fIV\fR."
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
option enables or disables bold,
underline, and color styling of
text written to standard error,
which is initially disabled.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is omitted, then it is taken to be
.nohy "\fBalways\fR."
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBalways\fR,"
then styling is enabled.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBnever\fR,"
then styling is disabled.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBauto\fR,"
then styling is enabled
if standard error is associated
with a terminal or disabled if not.
Any other value causes an error.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout\fR[\fB=\fIV\fR]"
option enables or disables bold,
underline, and color styling of
text written to standard output,
which is initially disabled.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is omitted, then it is taken to be
.nohy "\fBalways\fR."
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBalways\fR,"
then styling is enabled.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBnever\fR,"
then styling is disabled.
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBauto\fR,"
then styling is enabled
if standard output is associated
with a terminal or disabled if not.
Any other value causes an error.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-texi2any=\fIV\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-texi2any=\fIV\fR"
option sets the command name
that will be used to invoke the
.nohy "\fBtexi2any\fR"
program to
.nohy "\fIV\fR."
If
.nohy "\fIV\fR"
is
.nohy "\fBauto\fR,"
then the command name is inferred.
The copy of the
program that corresponds
to this copy of the manual page
behaves as if an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-texi2any=@TEXI2ANY_DEFAULT_TROFF@\fR"
option were added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and before any argument added by the
.nohy "\fBTEXI2ANY\fR"
environment variable.
Other copies may use other initial values.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
.TPZ
.nohy "\fB\-v\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
option enables printing.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-version\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-version\fR"
option writes text to standard output and
causes all remaining arguments to be ignored.
The text is the program's
name, package, version number,
release date, and copyright information.
.SH "OPERANDS"
.LP
Each operand is
processed in three phases:
printing, generation, and recursion.
Printing writes the
operand to standard output,
generation creates the file,
and recursion prepends the
names of prerequisite special
files to the remaining arguments.
Recursion also maintains the
directory part of the operand.
Various options
can be used to enable
or disable each phase,
but printing and generation
cannot be simultaneously disabled.
By default, only generation is enabled.
.SH "STDIN"
.LP
Not used.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
.LP
For each plain file
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
that is generated, the input file
.nohy "\fIR\fB.texi\fR"
is required and the input files
.nohy "\fIR\fB.top\fR,"
.nohy "\fIR\fB.top.texi\fR,"
.nohy "\fIR\fB.bot\fR,"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fB.bot.texi\fR"
are optional.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.LP
The following environment variables are supported:
.TP
.nohy "\fBAWK\fR"
.IPEZ
If the
.nohy "\fBAWK\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty value
.nohy "\fIV\fR,"
then an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-awk=\fIV\fR"
option is added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and after the implicit initial instance.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBAWK\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSED\fR"
.IPEZ
If the
.nohy "\fBSED\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty value
.nohy "\fIV\fR,"
then an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-sed=\fIV\fR"
option is added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and after the implicit initial instance.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBSED\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
.IPEZ
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty value
.nohy "\fIV\fR,"
then an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-style=\fIV\fR"
option is added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and before any arguments added by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
and
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
environment variables.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
.IPEZ
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty value
.nohy "\fIV\fR,"
then an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIV\fR"
option is added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and after any argument added by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
.IPEZ
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty value
.nohy "\fIV\fR,"
then an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=\fIV\fR"
option is added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and after any argument added by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBTEXI2ANY\fR"
.IPEZ
If the
.nohy "\fBTEXI2ANY\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty value
.nohy "\fIV\fR,"
then an instance of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-texi2any=\fIV\fR"
option is added to the
arguments at a position that
lies before all original arguments
and after the implicit initial instance.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBTEXI2ANY\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
.LP
Default.
.SH "STDOUT"
.LP
For each operand
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
for which printing is enabled,
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
followed by either a
newline or null character
is written to standard output.
The
.nohy "\fB\-\-help\fR,"
.nohy "\fB\-\-man\fR,"
and
.nohy "\fB\-\-version\fR"
options also write to standard output.
.SH "STDERR"
.LP
Each error causes a message
to be written to standard error.
Each line
of the message
is punctuated by either
an exclamation mark, colon,
or period character, which
indicate fatal, cautionary, and
informational errors, respectively.
If styling is enabled with the
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr\fR"
option, then
each line begins with
red, yellow, or cyan text if
the error is fatal, cautionary,
or informational, respectively.
Underlying programs
may also write their own
messages to standard error.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
.LP
For each operand
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
for which generation
is enabled, the file
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
is generated and the ten files
.nohy "\fIR\fB.gatbps0\fR"
through
.nohy "\fIR\fB.gatbps9\fR"
are reserved for temporary use.
If any temporary file
is nonregular or a directory,
then all of them are ignored
and generation fails.
Otherwise, some of them may
be used during generation and
all of them are deleted after
generation succeeds or fails.
If generation fails, then
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
is not necessarily deleted.
If the program is
terminated by a signal, then
no files are necessarily deleted.
.SH "PLAIN FILES"
.SH "MATHEMATICAL NOTATION IN TEXINFO"
.LP
A set of Texinfo macros
is provided to support a specific approach
to writing mathematical notation in Texinfo.
The idea is to write
two versions of each
mathematical expression:
one with the
.nohy "\fB@AT@tex\fR"
environment and one with the
.nohy "\fB@AT@ifnottex\fR"
environment.
The
.nohy "\fB@AT@tex\fR"
version defines the standard
appearance of the expression,
and the
.nohy "\fB@AT@ifnottex\fR"
version should try to imitate it.
For example:
.IP
.nf
@AT@tex
$x\ +\ y$
@AT@end\ tex
@AT@ifnottex
@AT@i{x}\ +\ @AT@i{y}
@AT@end\ ifnottex
.fi
.LP
The macros are then used in the
.nohy "\fB@AT@ifnottex\fR"
block to imitate various features of TeX.
For example, the
.nohy "\fB@AT@mdot\fR"
macro imitates the
.nohy "\fB\ecdot\fR"
control sequence.
The macro names have been chosen
to avoid collisions with the names of
Texinfo commands and TeX control sequences,
as recommended by the Texinfo manual.
.LP
Each macro
.nohy "\fB@AT@\fIM\fR"
is defined by the
.nohy "\fIM\fB.texi\fR"
special file, which also uses the
.nohy "\fIM\fBtexi\fR"
flag as an include guard so
that including the special file
multiple times is equivalent to
including it only the first time.
For example, the
.nohy "\fB@AT@mdot\fR"
macro is defined by the
.nohy "\fBmdot.texi\fR"
special file, which also uses the
.nohy "\fBmdottexi\fR"
flag as an include guard.
The
.nohy "\fBmath.texi\fR"
special file is also provided, which includes every
.nohy "\fIM\fB.texi\fR"
special file.
It can be generated under the effect of the
.nohy "\fB\-\-recursive\fR"
option to generate all
.nohy "\fIM\fB.texi\fR"
special files at once.
.LP
The macros insert symbols
as UTF-8 characters in Info
and plain text and as numeric
character references in Docbook,
HTML, and XML by default, or as ASCII
alternatives in all output formats if the
.nohy "\fBinsertascii\fR"
flag is set at their points of inclusion.
For example, the
.nohy "\fB@AT@mdot\fR"
macro inserts a UTF-8
dot operator character in
Info and plain text and an
.nohy "\fB&#x22C5;\fR"
character reference
in Docbook, HTML, and
XML by default, or an ASCII
.nohy "\fB*\fR"
character in all output formats if the
.nohy "\fBinsertascii\fR"
flag is set at its point of inclusion.
.LP
In Docbook, HTML, and XML, the macros use the
.nohy "\fB@AT@inlineraw\fR"
command to insert
numeric character references.
This command was
added in Texinfo 5.0,
which was released on 2013\-02\-16.
The macros automatically
detect older versions of
Texinfo, in which case they
insert UTF-8 characters instead.
.LP
The following table
lists the macros that
have no parameters, which
insert individual symbols.
Along with each macro
is its corresponding TeX
syntax, the Unicode character
that it inserts by default, and the
ASCII alternative that it inserts if the
.nohy "\fBinsertascii\fR"
flag is set at its point of inclusion.

The
.nohy "\fB@AT@sps{\fIL\fB,\ \fIS\fB,\ \fIR\fB}\fR"
and
.nohy "\fB@AT@sbs{\fIL\fB,\ \fIS\fB,\ \fIR\fB}\fR"
macros are provided for inserting
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
as a superscript or subscript.
In Docbook,
.nohy "\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
are ignored and
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
is inserted inside a
.nohy "\fB<superscript>\fR"
or
.nohy "\fB<subscript>\fR"
element.
In HTML and XML,
.nohy "\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
are ignored and
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
is inserted inside a
.nohy "\fB<sup>\fR"
or
.nohy "\fB<sub>\fR"
element.
In Info and plain text, an ASCII
.nohy "\fB^\fR"
or
.nohy "\fB_\fR"
character is inserted, followed by
.nohy "\fIL\fR,"
then
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then
.nohy "\fIR\fR,"
so that
.nohy "\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
serve as parentheses around
.nohy "\fIS\fR."
Note that
.nohy "\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
may be left blank.
For example, the following code produces
.nohy "\fBx^(y\ +\ z_w)\fR"
in Info and plain text:
.IP
.nf
@AT@tex
$x^{y\ +\ z_w}$
@AT@end\ tex
@AT@ifnottex
@AT@i{x}@AT@sps{(,\ @AT@i{y}\ +\ @AT@i{z}@AT@sbs{,\ @AT@i{w},\ },\ )}
@AT@end\ ifnottex
.fi
.LP
In Docbook, HTML, and XML, the
.nohy "\fB@AT@sps\fR"
and
.nohy "\fB@AT@sbs\fR"
macros use the
.nohy "\fB@AT@inlineraw\fR"
command to insert
superscript and subscript elements.
This command was
added in Texinfo 5.0,
which was released on 2013\-02\-16.
The macros automatically
detect older versions of
Texinfo, in which case they
behave as if the output format
were Info or plain text instead.
.SH "SPECIAL FILE REFERENCE"
.LP
This section provides a short
description of each special file.
Along with each
short description is a
reference to where the
full description can be found.
If a special file
supports comments,
then its short description is also
included in a comment at the top of the file.
The short descriptions can
also be shown by using the
.nohy "\fB\-\-help=\fIS\fR"
option.
.TP
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-AC\-COPYRIGHT.ac\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-AC\-COPYRIGHT.ac\fR"
special file calls the
.nohy "\fBAC_COPYRIGHT\fR"
Autoconf
macro with a message stating that some parts of the
.nohy "\fBconfigure\fR"
script are
from the package, and that the authors of those parts have waived their
rights to them by referencing the
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0.txt\fR"
special file.
This can be
included in another Autoconf file with the
.nohy "\fBm4_include\fR"
macro where the
.nohy "\fBAC_COPYRIGHT\fR"
call is desired to appear.
.TP
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-AM\-COPYRIGHT.am\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-AM\-COPYRIGHT.am\fR"
special file contains an Automake comment
that states that some parts of the
.nohy "\fBMakefile\fR"
are from the package, and
that the authors of those parts have waived their rights to them by
referencing the
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0.txt\fR"
special file.
This can be included in
another Automake file with the
.nohy "\fBinclude\fR"
directive where the comment is
desired to appear.
.TP
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-appendix.texi\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-appendix.texi\fR"
special file is the same as the
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0.txt\fR"
special file but formatted as a Texinfo appendix.
This can be included
in another Texinfo file with the
.nohy "\fB@AT@include\fR"
command where the appendix is
desired to appear.
The appendix is also labeled as
.nohy "\fB@AT@node CC0\fR"
so that it
follows the usual node structure and can be referenced.
.TP
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-commit.txt\fR"
.IPEZ
The
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-commit.txt\fR"
special file is a commit message template that
states that the author of the commit has waived their rights to it by
referencing the
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0.txt\fR"
special file.
This can be used with Git's
.nohy "\fBcommit.template\fR"
configuration variable, for example.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.LP
Exit status zero indicates success
and any other exit status indicates failure.
Success means that
all arguments were successfully processed
and failure means that one or more were not.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
.LP
All errors cause the
program to terminate except
perhaps when processing an operand,
in which case some errors only cause the
current phase to be canceled for the operand.
