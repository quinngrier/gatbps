.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH PLAIN FILES
.SH SPECIAL FILES
.SH TEMPORARY FILES
\fBgatbps\fR reserves the temporary files
\f(BIfile\fB.gatbps0\fR through \f(BIfile\fB.gatbps9\fR
for each \fIfile\fR operand.
If any of these is nonregular or a directory,
the operand fails.
Otherwise,
they are used
and deleted after the operand succeeds or fails.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables affect \fBgatbps\fR:
.TP
\fBAWK\fR
The preferred implementation of \fBawk\fR.
If unset or empty, the default is \fB@AWK@\fR.
This does not affect special files.
.TP
\fBSTYLE\fR
Setting the \fBSTYLE\fR
environment variable
to a nonempty string \fIS\fR
is equivalent to providing
the program argument
\fB--style\fR=\fIS\fR
before the actual program arguments
and before the program arguments
provided by the
\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR and \fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR
environment variables.
.TP
\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR
Setting the \fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR
environment variable
to a nonempty string \fIS\fR
is equivalent to providing
the program argument
\fB--style-stderr\fR=\fIS\fR
before the actual program arguments
and after the program argument
provided by the
\fBSTYLE\fR
environment variable.
.TP
\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR
Setting the \fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR
environment variable
to a nonempty string \fIS\fR
is equivalent to providing
the program argument
\fB--style-stdout\fR=\fIS\fR
before the actual program arguments
and after the program argument
provided by the
\fBSTYLE\fR
environment variable.
.SH EXIT STATUS
\fBgatbps\fR indicates success with exit status zero
and failure with any nonzero exit status.
In the first form,
success means that all \fIfile\fR operands succeeded
or that none were given
and writing to standard output succeeded.
In the second and third forms,
success means that writing to standard output succeeded.
