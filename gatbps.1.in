.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH PLAIN FILES
.SH SPECIAL FILES
.SH TEMPORARY FILES
\fBgatbps\fR reserves the ten temporary files
\f(BIfile\fB.gatbps0\fR through \f(BIfile\fB.gatbps9\fR
for each \fIfile\fR operand.
If any of these is a directory or nonregular,
the operand fails.
Otherwise,
the files are used in an unspecified way
and deleted after the operand succeeds or fails.
.SH EXIT STATUS
\fBgatbps\fR uses exit status zero to indicate success
and any other exit status to indicate failure.
In the first form,
success means that
no \fIfile\fR operands were given
or that all \fIfile\fR operands succeeded,
and failure means that
one or more \fIfile\fR operands failed
(all \fIfile\fR operands are always attempted).
The second and third forms always succeed.
General failures are always possible
(like failing to write to standard output)
and may cause \fBgatbps\fR to immediately exit.
