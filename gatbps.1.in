.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\fR[\fB=\fIS\fR]"
.IP0
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\fR"
option is replaced by a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style=always\fR"
option.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style=\fIS\fR"
option is replaced by a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option and a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=\fIS\fR"
option.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr\fR[\fB=\fIS\fR]"
.IP0
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr\fR"
option is replaced by a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=always\fR"
option.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=always\fR"
option enables bold, underline, and color
styling of text written to standard error.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=auto\fR"
option enables styling if standard error
is associated with a terminal
or disables styling if not.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option with any other
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
disables styling.
Styling is initially disabled and each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option updates it.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout\fR[\fB=\fIS\fR]"
.IP0
A
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout\fR"
option is replaced by a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=always\fR"
option.
A
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=\fIS\fR"
option is the same as a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option but affects standard output
instead of standard error.
.SH "PLAIN FILES"
.SH "SPECIAL FILES"
.SH "TEMPORARY FILES"
\fBgatbps\fR reserves the temporary files
\f(BIfile\fB.gatbps0\fR through \f(BIfile\fB.gatbps9\fR
for each \fIfile\fR operand.
If any of these is nonregular or a directory,
the operand fails.
Otherwise,
they are used
and deleted after the operand succeeds or fails.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables affect \fBgatbps\fR:
.TP
\fBAWK\fR
The preferred implementation of \fBawk\fR.
If unset or empty, the default is \fB@AWK@\fR.
This does not affect special files.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
.IP0
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty string
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style=\fIS\fR"
option is inserted at a location
that lies before any program arguments
and before any options inserted by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
and
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
environment variables.
Otherwise, there is no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
.IP0
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty string
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option is inserted at a location
that lies before any program arguments
and after any option inserted by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable.
Otherwise, there is no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
.IP0
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty string
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=\fIS\fR"
option is inserted at a location
that lies before any program arguments
and after any option inserted by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable.
Otherwise, there is no effect.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
\fBgatbps\fR indicates success with exit status zero
and failure with any nonzero exit status.
In the first form,
success means that all \fIfile\fR operands succeeded
or that none were given
and writing to standard output succeeded.
In the second and third forms,
success means that writing to standard output succeeded.
