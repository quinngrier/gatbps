.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH PLAIN FILES
.SH SPECIAL FILES
.SH TEMPORARY FILES
\fBgatbps\fR reserves the ten temporary files
\f(BIfile\fB.gatbps0\fR through \f(BIfile\fB.gatbps9\fR
for each \fIfile\fR operand.
If any of these is a directory or nonregular,
the operand fails.
Otherwise,
the files are used in an unspecified way
and deleted after the operand succeeds or fails.
.SH EXIT STATUS
\fBgatbps\fR indicates success with exit status zero
and failure with any nonzero exit status.
In the first form,
success means that all \fIfile\fR operands succeeded
or that none were given.
In the second and third forms,
success means that writing to standard output was successful.
