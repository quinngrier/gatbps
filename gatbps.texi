@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

GATBPS (pronunciation: gat-bee-pee-ESS)
provides a program named @t{gatbps}
that generates basic files for software packages@.
It was originally created to provide a small number
of shell scripts to be used with the GNU Autotools build
system, and its name stood for ``@b{G}NU @b{A}uto@b{t}ools
@b{B}oiler@b{p}late @b{S}cripts''@.
However, it quickly grew to provide other kinds of basic files,
and its name now stands for
``@b{G}ener@b{a}@b{t}e @b{B}asic @b{P}ackage @b{S}tuff''@.

@node Mathematical Notation in Texinfo
@chapter Mathematical Notation in Texinfo

GATBPS provides a collection of Texinfo
macros that support an alternative approach
to writing mathematical notation in Texinfo@.
The main idea is that @TeX{} is the gold standard
and the other output formats should strive to imitate it@.
Accordingly, each mathematical expression can be written
in both raw @TeX{} syntax and normal Texinfo syntax, like this:

@example
@@tex
$x + y$
@@end tex
@@ifnottex
@@i@{x@} + @@i@{y@}
@@end ifnottex
@end example
