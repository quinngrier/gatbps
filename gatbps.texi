@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

GATBPS (pronunciation: gat-bee-pee-ESS)
provides a program named @t{gatbps}
that generates basic files for software packages@.
It was originally created to provide a small number
of shell scripts to be used with the GNU Autotools build
system, and its name stood for ``@b{G}NU @b{A}uto@b{t}ools
@b{B}oiler@b{p}late @b{S}cripts''@.
However, it quickly grew to provide other kinds of basic files,
and its name now stands for
``@b{G}ener@b{a}@b{t}e @b{B}asic @b{P}ackage @b{S}tuff''@.

@node Mathematical Notation in Texinfo
@chapter Mathematical Notation in Texinfo

GATBPS provides a collection of Texinfo
macros that support an alternative approach
to writing mathematical notation in Texinfo@.
The idea is to write each expression in both
raw @TeX{} and plain Texinfo syntax, like this:

@example
@@tex
$x + y$
@@end tex
@@ifnottex
@@i@{x@} + @@i@{y@}
@@end ifnottex
@end example

@noindent
The macros are then used in the
@t{@@ifnottex}
section to imitate @TeX{}@.
For example, the
@t{@@mdot@{@}}
macro imitates the
@t{\cdot}
control sequence@.
The macro names are chosen
to avoid collisions with the names of
Texinfo commands and @TeX{} control sequences,
as recommended by the Texinfo manual@.

Each macro
@i{M}
is defined by the
@i{M}@t{.texi}
special file, which also uses the
@i{M}@t{texi}
flag as an include guard so that including the
file multiple times is equivalent to including
it only the first time@.
For example, the
@t{@@mdot@{@}}
macro is defined by the
@t{mdot.texi}
special file, which also uses the
@t{mdottexi}
flag as an include guard@.
The
@t{math.texi}
special file is also provided, which uses
@t{@@include}
commands to include the entire collection of macros@.
It can be generated with the
@t{--walk}
option to generate the entire collection at once@.

The macros insert special symbols as
UTF-8 characters in Info and plain text and
as character references in Docbook, HTML, and
XML by default, or as ASCII approximations in
all output formats if the
@t{ASCII}
flag is set at their points of inclusion@.
For example, the
@t{@@mdot@{@}}
macro inserts a UTF-8 dot
operator character (U+22C5)
in Info and plain text and an
@t{&sdot;}
character reference in Docbook, HTML, and
XML by default, or an ASCII asterisk
character (U+002A) in all output formats if the
@t{ASCII}
flag is set at its point of inclusion@.
The character references use entity names
if they exist or hexadecimal numbers if not@.

The following table lists the macros that have
no parameters, which insert individual symbols@.
Along with each macro is its corresponding @TeX{}
syntax, the Unicode character that it inserts
by default, and the ASCII approximation that
it inserts if the
@t{ASCII}
flag is set at its point of inclusion@.
If this manual is translated to @TeX{}
or any other output format without the
@t{ASCII}
flag set, then the table also
shows the symbol of each macro@.
