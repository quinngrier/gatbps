GATBPS (pronunciation: gat-bee-pee-ESS)
is a collection of basic software project files along with
a program named @t{gatbps} that generates these files@.
It was originally created to hold a small number
of helper scripts for the GNU Autotools build system
and its name stood for ``@b{G}NU @b{A}uto@b{t}ools
@b{B}oiler@b{p}late @b{S}cripts'', but it quickly grew in
scope and its name now stands for
``@b{G}ener@b{a}@b{t}e @b{B}asic @b{P}roject @b{S}tuff''@.
