@chapter Introduction

GATBPS (pronunciation: gat-bee-pee-ESS)
provides a program named @t{gatbps}
that generates basic files for software packages@.
It was originally created to provide a small number
of shell scripts to be used with the GNU Autotools build
system, and its name stood for ``@b{G}NU @b{A}uto@b{t}ools
@b{B}oiler@b{p}late @b{S}cripts''@.
However, it quickly grew to provide other kinds of basic files,
and its name now stands for
``@b{G}ener@b{a}@b{t}e @b{B}asic @b{P}ackage @b{S}tuff''@.
