@chapter @t{gatbps} Temporary Files

@w{@t{gatbps}}
reserves the ten temporary files
@w{@i{S}@t{.@:gatbps0}}
through
@w{@i{S}@t{.@:gatbps9}}
during the generation of an operand
@w{@i{S}@.}
If any of these
files is nonregular
or a directory, then
all of them are ignored
and the generation fails@.
Otherwise,
some of them may be utilized
during the generation, and all of them
are deleted after it succeeds or fails@.
