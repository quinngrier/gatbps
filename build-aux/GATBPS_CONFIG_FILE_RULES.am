## The above substitution adds prerequisites to the below targets, but
## Automake cannot see them because substitution occurs after Automake
## runs. If the below lines were omitted and the targets did not appear
## elsewhere, then Automake might not add them as prerequisites to the
## corresponding non-local targets, disconnecting the non-local targets
## from the new prerequisites. This is why the below lines are included.
