# With LC_ALL=C, locale-aware programs use the C locale instead of the
# current locale. This is generally the best approach for code that is
# not deliberately designed to work in other locales, as other locales
# may have surprising behavior. The locale affects many programs, like
# awk, grep, sed, and this shell instance itself. For more information,
# see the C standard, the POSIX standard, and the GNU C Library manual.
