@chapter @t{gatbps} Standard Error

Each error causes a message
to be written to standard error@.
Each line
of the message
is punctuated by either
an exclamation point, colon,
or full stop character, which
indicate fatal, cautionary, and
informational errors, respectively@.
The message uses
escape sequences if
styling is enabled via the
@w{@t{-@w{-}style-stderr}}
option, in which case each
line begins with red, yellow,
or cyan text if the error is fatal,
cautionary, or informational, respectively@.
Underlying programs
may also write their own
messages to standard error@.
