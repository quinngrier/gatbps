# With LC_ALL=C, locale-aware programs use the C locale instead of the
# current locale. This is generally the best approach for code that is
# not deliberately designed to work in other locales. The C locale has
# predictable behavior and is compatible with UTF-8. Other locales may
# have surprising behavior. This affects many important programs, like
# awk, grep, sed, and this shell instance itself. For more information,
# see the C standard, the POSIX standard, and the GNU C Library manual.

.SH "PLAIN FILES"
.SH "MATHEMATICAL NOTATION IN TEXINFO"
.LP
GATBPS provides a collection of Texinfo
macros that support an alternative approach
to writing mathematical notation in Texinfo.
The idea is to write each expression in both
raw TeX and plain Texinfo syntax.
For example:
.IPE
.nf
@AT@tex
$x + y$
@AT@end tex
@AT@ifnottex
@AT@i{x} + @AT@i{y}
@AT@end ifnottex
.fi
.LP
The macros are then used in the
.nohy "\fB@AT@ifnottex\fR"
section to imitate TeX.
For example, the
.nohy "\fB@AT@mdot\fR"
macro imitates the
.nohy "\fB\ecdot\fR"
control sequence.
The macro names are chosen
to avoid collisions with the names of
Texinfo commands and TeX control sequences,
as recommended by the Texinfo manual.
.LP
Each macro
.nohy "\fB@AT@\fIM\fR"
is defined by the
.nohy "\fIM\fB.texi\fR"
special file, which also uses the
.nohy "\fIM\fBtexi\fR"
flag as an include guard so that including the
file multiple times is equivalent to including
it only the first time.
For example, the
.nohy "\fB@AT@mdot\fR"
macro is defined by the
.nohy "\fBmdot.texi\fR"
special file, which also uses the
.nohy "\fBmdottexi\fR"
flag as an include guard.
The
.nohy "\fBmath.texi\fR"
special file is also provided, which uses
.nohy "\fB@AT@include\fR"
commands to include every
.nohy "\fIM\fB.texi\fR"
special file.
It can be generated with the
.nohy "\fB\-\-recursive\fR"
option to also generate every
.nohy "\fIM\fB.texi\fR"
special file at once.
.LP
The macros insert symbols as
UTF-8 characters in Info and plain text and
as numeric character references in Docbook, HTML, and
XML by default, or as ASCII alternatives in
all output formats if the
.nohy "\fBinsertascii\fR"
flag is set at their points of inclusion.
For example, the
.nohy "\fB@AT@mdot\fR"
macro inserts a UTF-8 dot
operator character
in Info and plain text and an
.nohy "\fB&#x22C5;\fR"
character reference in Docbook, HTML, and
XML by default, or an ASCII
.nohy "\fB*\fR"
character in all output formats if the
.nohy "\fBinsertascii\fR"
flag is set at its point of inclusion.
.LP
In Docbook, HTML, and XML, the macros use the
.nohy "\fB@AT@inlineraw\fR"
command to insert numeric character references.
This command was added in Texinfo 5.0,
which was released on 2013\-02\-16.
The macros automatically detect older versions of
Texinfo, in which case they insert UTF-8 characters instead.
.LP
The following table lists the macros that have
no parameters, which insert individual symbols.
Along with each macro is its corresponding TeX
syntax, the Unicode character that it inserts
by default, and the ASCII alternative that
it inserts if the
.nohy "\fBinsertascii\fR"
flag is set at its point of inclusion.

The
.nohy "\fB@AT@sps{\fIL\fB,\ \fIS\fB,\ \fIR\fB}\fR"
and
.nohy "\fB@AT@sbs{\fIL\fB,\ \fIS\fB,\ \fIR\fB}\fR"
macros are provided for inserting
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
as a superscript or subscript.
In Docbook,
.nohy "\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
are ignored and
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
is inserted inside a
.nohy "\fB<superscript>\fR"
or
.nohy "\fB<subscript>\fR"
element.
In HTML and XML,
.nohy "\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
are ignored and
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
is inserted inside a
.nohy "\fB<sup>\fR"
or
.nohy "\fB<sub>\fR"
element.
In Info and plain text, an ASCII
.nohy "\fB^\fR"
or
.nohy "\fB_\fR"
character is inserted, followed by
.nohy "\fIL\fR,"
then
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then
.nohy "\fIR\fR,"
so that
.nohy "\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
act as parentheses around
.nohy "\fIS\fR."
Note that
.nohy "\fIL\fR"
and
.nohy "\fIR\fR"
can be left blank.
For example, the following code produces
.nohy "\fBx^(y\ +\ z_w)\fR"
in Info and plain text:
.IPE
.nf
@AT@tex
$x^{y\ +\ z_w}$
@AT@end tex
@AT@ifnottex
@AT@i{x}@AT@sps{(,\ @AT@i{y}\ +\ @AT@i{z}@AT@sbs{,\ @AT@i{w},\ },\ )}
@AT@end ifnottex
.fi
.LP
In Docbook, HTML, and XML, the
.nohy "\fB@AT@sps\fR"
and
.nohy "\fB@AT@sbs\fR"
macros use the
.nohy "\fB@AT@inlineraw\fR"
command to insert superscript and subscript elements.
This command was added in Texinfo 5.0,
which was released on 2013\-02\-16.
The macros automatically detect older versions of
Texinfo, in which case they behave
as if the output format were Info
or plain text instead.
.SH "SPECIAL FILE REFERENCE"
.LP
This section provides a short
description of each special file.
Along with each short description is a reference to
where the corresponding full description can be found.
The short descriptions are the same as those shown by the
.nohy "\fB\-\-help=\fIS\fR"
option.
.TP
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-AC\-COPYRIGHT.ac\fR"
.IPE0
The
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0\-AC\-COPYRIGHT.ac\fR"
special file calls the
.nohy "\fBAC_COPYRIGHT\fR"
Autoconf
macro with a message stating that some parts of the
.nohy "\fBconfigure\fR"
script are
from the package, and that the authors of those parts have waived their
rights to them by referencing the
.nohy "\fBCC0\-1.0.txt\fR"
special file.
This can be
included in another Autoconf file with the
.nohy "\fBm4_include\fR"

@AT@heading Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an ``owner'') of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a ``Work'').

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works (``Commons'') that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the ``Affirmer''), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

@AT@enumerate
@AT@item
@AT@b{Copyright and Related Rights.} A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (``Copyright and
Related Rights''). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

@AT@enumerate a
@AT@item
     the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;

@AT@item
     moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

@AT@item
     publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;

@AT@item
     rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

@AT@item
     rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;

@AT@item
     database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and

@AT@item
     other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.
@AT@end enumerate

@AT@item
@AT@b{Waiver.} To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the ``Waiver''). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

@AT@item
@AT@b{Public License Fallback.} Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
``License''). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

@AT@item
@AT@b{Limitations and Disclaimers.}

@AT@enumerate a
@AT@item
    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

@AT@item
    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

@AT@item
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.

@AT@item
    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

# With LC_ALL=C, locale-aware programs use the C locale instead of the

# not deliberately designed to work in other locales. The C locale has
# predictable behavior and is compatible with UTF-8. Other locales may
# have surprising behavior. This affects many important programs, like
# awk, grep, sed, and this shell instance itself. For more information,
# see the C standard, the POSIX standard, and the GNU C Library manual.
