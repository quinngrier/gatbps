# With LC_ALL=C, locale-aware programs use the C locale instead of the
# current locale. This is generally the best approach for code that is
# not deliberately designed to work in other locales. The C locale has
# predictable behavior and is compatible with UTF-8. Other locales may
# have surprising behavior. This affects many important programs, like
# awk, grep, sed, and this shell instance itself. For more information,
# see the C standard, the POSIX standard, and the GNU C Library manual.

Each file is classified by its name as either plain or special. In the
first form, the list of special files is shown if no file operands are
given. Any other file is plain. All plain files are created in the same
way, but each special file is created in a unique way. More information
on how a given file will be created can be shown with the second form.

.nohy @AWK_TROFF@
by default.
Each

.nohy "\fIS\fR."
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\fR[\fB=\fIS\fR]"
.IP0
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\fR"
option is replaced by a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style=always\fR"
option.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style=\fIS\fR"
option is replaced by a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option and a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=\fIS\fR"
option.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr\fR[\fB=\fIS\fR]"
.IP0
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr\fR"
option is replaced by a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=always\fR"
option.
Bold, underline, and color styling
of text written to standard error
is initially disabled, and each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option enables or disables it.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=always\fR"
option enables it.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=auto\fR"
option enables it if standard error
is associated with a terminal
or disables it if not.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option with any other
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
disables it.
.TP
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout\fR[\fB=\fIS\fR]"
.IP0
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout\fR"
option is replaced by a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=always\fR"
option.
Bold, underline, and color styling
of text written to standard output
is initially disabled, and each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=\fIS\fR"
option enables or disables it.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=always\fR"
option enables it.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=auto\fR"
option enables it if standard output
is associated with a terminal
or disables it if not.
Each
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=\fIS\fR"
option with any other
.nohy "\fIS\fR"
disables it.
.SH "PLAIN FILES"
.SH "SPECIAL FILES"
.SH "TEMPORARY FILES"
\fBgatbps\fR reserves the temporary files
\f(BIfile\fB.gatbps0\fR through \f(BIfile\fB.gatbps9\fR
for each \fIfile\fR operand.
If any of these is nonregular or a directory,
the operand fails.
Otherwise,
they are used
and deleted after the operand succeeds or fails.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables affect \fBgatbps\fR:
.TP
.nohy "\fBAWK\fR"
.IP0
If the
.nohy "\fBAWK\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty string
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then an
.nohy "\fB\-\-awk=\fIS\fR"
option is added to
the program arguments
at a position that lies before
the original program arguments.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBAWK\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
.IP0
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty string
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style=\fIS\fR"
option is added to
the program arguments
at a position that lies before
the original program arguments
and before the options added by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
and
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
environment variables.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
.IP0
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty string
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stderr=\fIS\fR"
option is added to
the program arguments
at a position that lies before
the original program arguments
and after the option added by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDERR\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.TP
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
.IP0
If the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
environment variable
is set to a nonempty string
.nohy "\fIS\fR,"
then a
.nohy "\fB\-\-style\-stdout=\fIS\fR"
option is added to
the program arguments
at a position that lies before
the original program arguments
and after the option added by the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE\fR"
environment variable.
Otherwise, the
.nohy "\fBSTYLE_STDOUT\fR"
environment variable has no effect.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
\fBgatbps\fR indicates success with exit status zero
and failure with any nonzero exit status.
In the first form,
success means that all \fIfile\fR operands succeeded
or that none were given
and writing to standard output succeeded.
In the second and third forms,
success means that writing to standard output succeeded.

@heading Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an ``owner'') of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a ``Work'').

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works (``Commons'') that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the ``Affirmer''), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

@enumerate
@item
@b{Copyright and Related Rights.} A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (``Copyright and
Related Rights''). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

@enumerate a
@item
     the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;

@item
     moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

@item
     publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;

@item
     rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

@item
     rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;

@item
     database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and

@item
     other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.
@end enumerate

@item
@b{Waiver.} To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the ``Waiver''). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

@item
@b{Public License Fallback.} Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
``License''). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

@item
@b{Limitations and Disclaimers.}

@enumerate a
@item
    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

@item
    Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

@item
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.

@item
    Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,

    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.
