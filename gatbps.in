Usage: gatbps [FILE]...
Create project management files.

Each FILE is classified by its name as either regular or special. There
is a fixed list of special FILE names, which is printed if no arguments
are given. Any other FILE is regular.

Each regular FILE is created by adding startup and shutdown code to
FILE.texi and calling texi2any --plaintext. If FILE.top exists, it is
prepended to FILE. Otherwise, if FILE.top.texi exists, it is processed
in the same way as FILE.texi and prepended to FILE. The same action is
taken for FILE.bot(.texi), but appending to FILE instead of prepending.

Each special FILE is filled with either preset code or information
collected from version control. Among other things, this allows for the
creation of a version string, release date, authors list, and changelog.

Try 'man gatbps' or 'info gatbps' for more information.
